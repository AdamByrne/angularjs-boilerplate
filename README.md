white-angularjs-app
==========================

White application with boilerplate code for AngularJS app. Extremely reduced, simple, fast way to start and grab the concepts behind AngularJS.

This application can be use as a simple example of : 

- How to start an angularJS app with nice directory structure and well-named files
- How to test a specific concept (a new filter, a housemade directive, etc) in complete isolation of your already-old-and-complex-angularJS-app.
- How to declare properly services, directives, etc, in a readable, scalable way.

It was first forked from the Angular Seed project, but was very simplified, I also added a few basic concept (dependency injection, real-world directive) that should appear in such example.

**Note:** There are no tools or server required to run this example.

## Run

Go to http://adambyrne.github.io/angularjs-boilerplate


## Directory structure (interesting parts)
